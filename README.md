# 🛒 OOP Marketplace System (C++)

This is a console-based marketplace simulation developed in C++ during my **first year in university**. It served as a foundational project to learn and apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as:

- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Class separation and modular design
- File I/O for storing product, cart, and user data

---

## 💡 Project Overview

The system includes key components of an online market, such as:

- 🛍️ **Product Catalog** (with text file storage)
- 🧾 **Orders & Payments**
- 🛒 **Shopping Cart & Wishlist**
- ⭐ **Product Reviews**
- 💸 **Promotions**
- 📤 **Social Sharing Simulation**

---

## 🧠 Educational Value

This project reflects my early coding experience and helped me build confidence in OOP and structured programming. While basic in functionality, it demonstrates clear separation of concerns and data handling without databases.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio
- **Data Storage:** Local `.txt` files
